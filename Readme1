This script will update your system and install additional software.
It will also turn error messages off (good idea, believe me).



	USAGE:

____________________________________________________________________________________________
 1.  Unpack first_after_d.tar into your Home folder.

 2. Start Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t)

 3. Copy following commands, ONE LINE AT A TIME, and paste them into Terminal. Confirm with Enter.

cd first_after_d
chmod a+x first_after_install
./first_after_install
____________________________________________________________________________________________


When you need to enter your password in Terminal, nothing will show while you type. That is normal - insert your password carefully and press Enter.

Script will do everything else.





	CUSTOMIZE

At the beginning of the script, from line 27 to line 49, you can find three variables (grub_backgound, ubuntu_packages and lubuntu_packages) you can change.
	Be sure to know what you're doing.



1.   You can change grub background image by uncommenting it within the script.

Inside this folder are 3 possible grub background image choices: grub_anime.png, grub_sweat.png and grub_ubupatt.png.
	grub_ubupatt.png is current choice.

If you want to change it, just uncomment (remove #) desired image, like this:
#grub_backgound="grub_ubupatt.png"
grub_backgound="grub_anime.png"
#grub_backgound="grub_sweat.png"

In above example, grub_anime.png will be used.

	Don't forget to save...



2.	You can add or remove some packages.

Packages to install are defined in two variables:
	ubuntu_packages  (If you use Ubuntu)
